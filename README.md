# System Implementation and Testing for Predictive Immunization Defaulting

This document outlines the system implementation and testing process for a Predictive Immunization Defaulting system. The system utilizes machine learning models to predict whether individuals are likely to default on their scheduled immunizations based on demographic and vaccination history data.

## Implementation Overview
The implementation involves developing a Streamlit web application that allows users to upload immunization data, predict defaulting status, and visualize predictions on a geographical map.

## System Components
The system comprises the following components:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the uploaded immunization data.
- **Model Prediction**: Uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict defaulting statuses based on preprocessed data.
- **Geographical Visualization**: Generates a map visualization showing predicted defaulting statuses for geographical locations.

## Implementation Steps
### Data Preprocessing
Implements data preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the uploaded immunization data for model prediction.

### Model Prediction
Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to predict defaulting statuses based on the preprocessed data.

### Geographical Visualization
Generates a geographical map visualization using Folium library, displaying predicted defaulting statuses for various locations.

## Testing
The system is tested to ensure its functionality and accuracy in predicting defaulting statuses. Testing involves:

- Uploading sample immunization datasets to validate data preprocessing.
- Testing the model's predictions against known defaulting statuses to evaluate accuracy.
- Verifying the accuracy of geographical visualizations by comparing predicted statuses with ground truth data.

## Conclusion
The implementation and testing process for the Predictive Immunization Defaulting system demonstrate its capability to predict defaulting statuses based on demographic and vaccination history data. The system's accuracy and functionality in visualizing predictions on a geographical map provide valuable insights for public health decision-makers and stakeholders.
